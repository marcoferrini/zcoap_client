# zcoap_client
  Implementation of a CoAP client based on libcoap v4.2.0 (https://libcoap.net/doc/reference/4.2.0/)
  
## TODO 
  * Test DTLS layer with PKI
  * Resolve a bug: the program crashes when doing a block wise transfer with a payload larger than 143 bytes (size of the entire payload not of each block)
